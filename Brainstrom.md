# IOS 101 Capstone Project brainstrom
Author: Mohammad J. Islam
# Idea
For this project, I want to build something that will be very helpful to my day to day use. 
One thing that will help me will be budget tracker or habit tracker. 
I think a habit tracker will be much easier to approach, since we have done a todo list project. 

we will have:
  * Habit list.
  * Add/ edit habits.
  * Mark habits done for the day.
  * Save data.
  * Streak count.
  * 7 day progress. 
  * Filter (Today/ all).
  * Optional daily notification.
